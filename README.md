# Octopus State API

We are changing 100,000years old agricultural practices and harvest(goods and produce) trading using decentralized protocols.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following install in your system to run Deli locally

- [Go](https://golang.org) - An open source programming language
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - An open source relational database

Navigate to their specific website to get resources on how to install them locally depending on your operating system.

### Installing

Run the following command to verify go programming language installation;

```go

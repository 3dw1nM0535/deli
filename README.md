# Byte

We are pledging to create a peer-to-peer system that will give everyone access to clean, healthy, available, and affordable food. A system modeled on social entrepreneurship that will solve problems in the current regime of youth unemployment, financial crisis, food
security, and provide social solutions by being part of an awesome community; because a community is a shared responsibility. We should be able to interact with food systems by understanding where our food comes from, the people involved in delivering the food to us, and what we need to do to create delicious and nutritious meals to be experienced by everyone, regardless of economic status or background. We are fighting to create a system that is conscious and respectful of the health of the environment, the quality of the food, the safety of the grower, and the future of consumers; not leaving behind the future generations.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following install in your system to run Deli locally

- [Go](https://golang.org) - An open source programming language
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - An open source relational database

Navigate to their specific website to get resources on how to install them locally depending on your operating system.

### Installing

Run the following command to verify go programming language installation;

```go
go version
```

You should get the following output on Linux based operation system
